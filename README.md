<H2> Are the current website visitors potential buyers?</H2>
Smatfin would like to formally launch its online store in Zambia. An online store was added to the website in January 2023. Links to the store were added to all social media profiles and some paid ads. However, few buyers proceeded to the website because Zambians prefer to shop through WhatsApp catalogues. The objective of this project is to analyse website data collected using Google Analytics. Meaningful insights can help influence marketing efforts.

<H2>Recommendations</H2>

The website audience has potential to grow and convert. The audience is global, but there is also a regional specific audience. Below are recommendations to aid the launch of the online store.

<ul>
<li>Run targeted advertising or promotional campaigns in Lusaka and Kitwe where there is high potential</li>

<li>Create region-specific content or offers tailored to the preferences and needs of users in these areas.</li>

<li>Majority of the audience are mobile phone users. Ensure the site is fully responsive and offers a seamless experience on mobile devices. </li>

<li>Create dedicated landing pages for specific traffic sources to provide a more relevant experience.</li>

<li>To reduce the bounce rate, improve content quality, optimize page load speed, and enhance design and usability.</li>

<li>To optimize conversion paths, analyze user flow to identify where users drop off and optimize these paths. Add products from the store that are in sync with the content</li>

<li>Reassess marketing channels and targeting strategies to ensure the right audience is being attracted. </li>
