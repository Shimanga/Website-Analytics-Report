<H2> Are the current website visitors potential buyers?</H2>
Smatfin would like to formally launch its online store in Zambia. An online store was added to the website in January 2023. Links to the store were added to all social media profiles and some paid ads. However, few buyers proceeded to the website because Zambians prefer to shop through WhatsApp catalogues. The objective of this project is to analyse website data collected through Google Analytics and get meaningful insights that can influence marketing efforts.
